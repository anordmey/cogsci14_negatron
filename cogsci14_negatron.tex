\section{Introduction}

%REVAMP TO FOCUS ON INFORMATIVENESS/PRAGMATICS HYPOTHESIS

Language is a powerful tool that allows us to describe not only the state of the world as we see it, but also the world as it is not. For example, if my friend always wears a baseball cap, and one day I see her and she is not wearing her hat, I may draw attention to this violation of expectations by saying ``You aren't wearing your hat!''.  In these types of situations, myself and other speakers might produce a negative sentence instead of a positive one because it is more informative in these contexts.  [[[I had feedback from multiple people to include a specific example here, instead of listing general contexts where negation might occur.  I like the suggestion, but I am having trouble picking a good example.  I use a different example below (paragraph 3, the car example), but I wonder if I should pick one example and then refer back to it?  Let me know if some particularly awesome example happens to pop into your head.  ]]]

Despite the fact that negation has clear uses in communication, many researchers have found that people are slower to evaluate negative sentences than positive ones.  Furthermore, there is an interaction between the type of sentence and truth value, with people responding fastest to true positive sentences and \emph{slowest} to true negative sentences \cite{hclark1972, carpenter1975, just1971, just1976}.  In addition, research using electroencephalography has shown that sentences in which the final noun is semantically unexpected elicit a more negative peak at the N400, even when a negative is introduced to make the sentence logically true.  Similar results have been found measuring reaction time in probe-recognition tasks \cite{kaup2003, kaup2006, hasson2006}.  Collectively this work suggests that negative sentences are more difficult to process than positive sentences.  
 
There is a critical difference, however, between evaluating single sentences in a laboratory setting and comprehending speech in the real world. According to Grice's cooperative principle \cite{grice1975}, speakers should produce utterances that are appropriately informative, relevant, and unambiguous.  Negative sentences presented without any contextual support may violate this principle.  If my friend asks me what I did this week, and I respond ``I didn't buy a car'', my contribution to the conversation is neither relevant nor informative.  If my friend knows that I have been shopping for a new car, however, then the statement ``I didn't buy a car'' becomes relevant and informative. A number of studies have demonstrated that the processing difficulty incurred by negative sentences is mitigated by the presence of a supportive pragmatic context \cite{wason1965, glenberg1999, ludtke2006, nieuwland2008, dale2011}.   While this work suggests that context plays an important role in the processing of negative sentences, no previous work has thoroughly examined how manipulating the strength of the context might influence this facilitation effect.

What is the computational mechanism by which context influences the processing of negation?  We propose that negative sentences are more informative when presented in contexts that set up a strong expectation that is violated.  Recent work by Frank and Goodman (2012) \nocite{frank2012} has attempted to quantify the pragmatic inferences that adults make when playing simple ``language games''. The assumption underlying this work is that speakers are informative - that is, they will produce utterances that will pick out smaller subsets of the context, leaving as little ambiguity as possible for the listener.  We use this theory to help clarify the role of context in negative sentence processing.  If listeners predict that speakers will choose more informative sentences, then they should process negative sentences that are highly informative in context faster than negative sentences that are less informative in context.  This hypothesis draws on the idea of \emph{surprisal}, an information-theoretic measure of the amount of information contained in an utterance.  This theory proposes that expectations about what utterance a speaker will produce are related to a listener's speed to evaluate that sentence  (see \citeNP{levy2008} for a syntactic theory of surprisal).  We draw on this theory in the realm of pragmatics, developing a pragmatic theory of surprisal to explain the effect of context on the processing of negative sentences.  

We begin by replicating the finding that context facilitates the processing of negative sentences in a sentence verification task, using visual contexts to set up expectations about the base rate of a certain characteristic (Study 1).  We then explore whether the strength of the context matters, by varying the base rate parametrically (Studies 2a and 2b).  Although previous work has demonstrated that some contexts are more effective than others \cite{ludtke2006, dale2011}, this is the first attempt to systematically vary the strength of the context and show that context has a graded effect on the processing of negative sentences.  We then develop a model to compute the surprisal of a sentence in these different pragmatic contexts, and find that a model based on pragmatic informativeness predicts the relationship between context and participant reaction time.  

\section{Study 1: Context vs. No Context}
Study 1 replicates the finding that a simple visual context reduces the latency to evaluate negative sentences \cite{wason1965}.  The study was conducted using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (mTurk) website, an online crowd-sourcing platform for conducting survey research, and was programmed using Javascript, allowing us to collect reaction times for participants' responses.  Previous work has 
demonstrated that AMT is an effective tool for collecting reaction time data \cite{crump2013}.  

We used a sentence verification task in which participants were asked to evaluate whether positive and negative sentences (e.g. ``Bob has/has no apples'') were true or false compared to a picture (e.g. of a person holding apples or holding nothing; see Figure \ref{fig:trial}).  Half of the participants first viewed a context screen which showed three characters holding the named item (e.g. three boys standing with apples).  Previous work examining context effects on the processing of negative sentences required participants to actively engage with the context, either by describing the stimuli \cite{wason1965} or by reading sentences \cite{glenberg1999, ludtke2006, dale2011}.  This study explores whether a passively-viewed visual context is sufficient for facilitating the processing of negative sentences.  
\subsection{Method}

\subsubsection{Participants}
%cut out demographic info?
One hundred participants were recruited to participate in an online experiment through the mTurk website.  Participants ranged in age from 18-65; 63 were male and 37 female.  Participation was restricted to individuals in the United States.  Participants were paid 30 cents to participate in the study, which took approximately 5 minutes to complete.  

\subsubsection{Stimuli}

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[width=3.25in]{figures/negatron_trialfig2.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:trial} An example of a context slide and a trial slide (true negative). }
\vspace{-5mm}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}

Twenty-eight trial items were created in which a character was shown holding either two of the same common, recognizable objects (e.g. two apples, buckets, toy cars, cookies, flowers, kites, umbrellas, etc.), or holding nothing.  On each trial, beneath the picture, was a sentence of the form ``[NAME] has/has no [ITEM]''.  Half of the sentences were positive and half were negative, and they were paired with pictures such that half were true and half were false.  
%This negative construction was used to make the negative sentences match the positive sentences as closely as possible, with the only difference being the presence or absence of the word ``no''.  

The experiment was fully crossed, with participants receiving 7 true positive, 7 false positive, 7 true negative and 7 false negative sentences over the course of the study.  Trials were presented to participants in a randomized order.  

Participants were randomly assigned to the ``No Context'' condition or the ``Context'' condition.  Participants in the ``No Context'' condition saw a blank screen with a fixation cross in the center before each trial, while participants in the ``Context'' condition viewed a context slide before each trial.  The context slide showed a picture of three characters, each holding two identical items.  The characters in the context condition all differed from the trial character and from each other in hair and shirt color.  The context slide instructed participants to ``Look at these [boys/girls]!''  An example of a context slide and a trial slide can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:trial}.  


\subsubsection{Procedure}
%Cut this down - cut down practice trial info?
Participants were first presented with an instructions screen which described the task and informed them that they would be participating in a psychology experiment and could stop at any time.  Once participants accepted the task, they were given eight practice trials.  During the practice trials, a pop-up window informed participants if they were incorrect.  

Before each trial, participants either viewed a blank screen with a fixation cross or a context screen, depending on the condition they were assigned to.  The experiment automatically advanced after 3 seconds.  They then saw a picture and a sentence about the picture, and they were asked to read the sentence and select whether it was true or false by pressing ``Q'' (with their left hand) for false or ``P'' (with their right hand) for true.  Participants were instructed to answer as quickly and accurately as possible.  Once participants made their selection, they were automatically brought to the next trial after a 500 ms pause.  Reaction times, measured as the time from when the pictures/sentence were presented to the moment when the response was made, were recorded for each trial.

%At the end of the experiment, participants were taken to a screen that collected demographic information.  Participants were required to enter their gender, age, and native language, and then were invited to provide optional comments about the task.  

\subsubsection{Data Processing}
%Put data processign stuff here - or maybe in Participants section???  Cut this down.

%%%REDO ANALYSES - TRIM OUTLIERS AFTER TAKING LOG RT
Six participants who listed a language other than English as their native language were excluded from analysis.  Seven additional participants were excluded for having participated in a previous iteration of the experiment.  Four participants were excluded for having an overall accuracy of below 80\%.  Thus, data from a total of 83 participants were analyzed, 40 in the no context condition and 40 in the context condition.  (CHECK THIS)

Only correct trials were analyzed.  Trials with RTs greater than 3 standard deviations from the mean in log space were also excluded from the analysis.

%%%REDO RESULTS SECTION - PUT MAIN FINDINGS FIRST

Study 1 examined the effect of a visual context on the processing of negative sentences.  Previous research led us to expect a main effect of context \cite{wason1965, glenberg1999, ludtke2006, nieuwland2008, dale2011}, such that  participants in the context condition, who first viewed a visual context setting up an expectation (e.g. that boys have apples), would show faster responses to negative sentences than participants in the no context condition.  As the data in Figure \ref{fig:e1line} show, there appears to have been a facilitating effect of context, particularly for true negative sentences, such that participants who first viewed the context slides had lower RTs.  

To examine the reliability of the context effect, we fit a linear mixed-effects model to reaction times in response to sentences.  We examined the interaction between sentence type, truth value, and context on reaction times.\footnote{All mixed-effects models were fit using the lme4 package in R version 2.15.3.  The model specification was as follows: \texttt{RT $\sim$ sentence~$\times$~truth~$\times$~context + (sentence~$\times$~truth~\textbar~subject) +  (sentence~$\times$~truth~\textbar~item)}.  Significance was calculated using the standard normal approximation to the $t$ distribution \cite{barr2013}.}  Results of this model show a main effect of truth value, with significant faster reaction times for true sentences compared to false sentences ($\beta= -207$, $p< .001$).  Although there was no main effect of negation across both conditions, there was an interaction between sentence type and truth value ($\beta= 282$, $p< .001$), replicating the finding that participants respond fastest to true positive sentences but slowest to true negative sentences  \cite{hclark1972}.  However, there was a significant 3-way interaction between context condition, sentence type, and truth value ($\beta= -249$, $p< .01$), suggesting that this interaction was primarily driven by the slow RTs for true negative sentences in the no context condition.  

\subsection{Discussion}

Study 1 provides further evidence for the effect of context on the processing of negative sentences.  Several previous studies have shown that embedding negative sentences in a supportive linguistic context leads to faster processing of negative sentences \cite{wason1965, glenberg1999, ludtke2006, dale2011}.  In this study, we presented some participants with a visual context that was designed to set up an expectation for what the trial picture might look like.  We found that viewing these contexts before each trial lead to faster processing of negative sentences, with true negative sentences showing the greatest effect.  

To understand why context had the greatest effect on true negative sentences, consider what a true negative trial looks like to a participant in the no context condition.  These are trials in which the participant has no expectation about what the character might be holding, because no context was provided to set up such an expectation.  The participant would then see a picture of a boy, not holding anything, with the sentence ``Bob has no apples''.  These types of trials likely cause participants to falter because there is no reason for ``apples'' to be mentioned at all.  However, when a participant first views a context such as the one pictured in Figure \ref{fig:trial}, they can form an expectation that boys hold apples.  Now, when the trial shows a boy with no apples, a sentence such as ``Bob has no apples'' makes sense and can be processed rapidly, because the image violates an expectation that boys should have apples.  

Study 1 contributes to a body of evidence suggesting that negative sentences are more felicitous when they are used to negate an expectation that participants might hold, and that such expectations can be set up by an appropriate context.  In Study 2, we examine how systematically manipulating the context might produce changes in reaction times by altering the strength of the expectations set up by the context.  

\section{Study 2: Varying strength of context}

%From Mike: "How about starting with a clear statement of the question: Ò

Should all contexts be equally helpful in processing negation? In Study 2, we test the idea that the processing of negation is facilitated in contexts in which negative sentences would be most informative.  In Study 1, the sentence ``Bob has no apples'' is highly informative in reference to a boy with no apples if you have first seen a context in which every boy has apples, because a boy with no apples violates the expectation set up by the context that most boys have apples.  However, if only one of the boys in the context had an apple, the sentence ``Bob has no apples'' is less informative because the expectation that boys will have apples is weaker in this context.

In Study 2, we quantitatively manipulated the strength of the context.  Participants saw contexts consisting of either three (Study 2a) or four (Study 2b) characters in which none, one, two, three, or four of the characters were holding the target item.  If one thinks of the contexts as giving participants a glimpse into the ``world'' that each trial exists in, the context gives the participant a small sample of the base rate of what the characters in this world look like.  By manipulating this base rate, we can change peoples' expectations about what the trial character will look like.  If the differences in reaction times between the no context and the context condition in Study 1 are due to the relative informativeness of the negative utterance based on the context, we should expect to see a linear relationship between the strength of the context and reaction time in response to negative sentences. 

\subsection{Method}

\subsubsection{Participants } 
%CUT THIS DOWN
Six hundred ($n_{2a}$=200; $n_{2b}$=400) participants were recruited to participate in an online experiment through the mTurk website.  Participants ranged in age from 18-over 65; in Study 2a 129 participants were male and 71 were female and in Study 2b 205 participants were male and 195 were female.  Participation was restricted to individuals in the United States.  Participants were paid 30 cents to participate in the study, which took approximately 5 minutes to complete.  

\subsubsection{Stimuli}
\emph{Study 2a} 

%From Mike: "There must be a shorter way to say this:  Context conditions showed 0 (ÒnoneÓ), 1, 2, or 3 (ÒallÓ) of the characters holding objects."

Study 2a used the same 28 trial items and sentence types as those used in Study .  A between-subjects ``context'' factor determined what type of context participants saw.  Context conditions showed 0 (ÒnoneÓ), 1, 2, or 3 (ÒallÓ) of the characters holding objects."  Trial stimuli were identical to the stimuli used in Study 1.  

\emph{Study 2b}
In Study 2b, the number of items was increased to 48.  The contexts were the same as those in Study 2a, except that each context contained 4 boys and there were therefore 5 context conditions (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4).  

\subsubsection{Procedure}
 The procedure for Study 2a was identical to the procedure in Study 1, with participants randomly assigned to one of the four context conditions.  
 
 In Study 2b, participants were given four seconds (instead of three) to look at the context before the experiment automatically advanced.  This was changed to give participants more time to look at the slightly larger contexts; the procedure was otherwise identical to Studies 1 and 2a.  
 
 \subsubsection{Data Processing}
%Put data processign stuff here - or maybe in Participants section???  Cut this down.

%%%REDO ANALYSES - TRIM OUTLIERS AFTER TAKING LOG RT
Twenty-three participants who listed a language other than English as their native language were excluded from analysis (7 in 2a and 16 in 2b).  Thirty-six additional participants were excluded for participating in a previous iteration of the experiment (15 in 2a and 21 in 2b).  Thirty-five participants were excluded for having an overall accuracy of below 80\% (11 in 2a and 24 in 2b).  Thus, a data from a total of 167 participants in Study 2a and 339 participants in Study 2b were analyzed.  
 
As in Study 1, only correct trials were analyzed and trials with RTs greater than 3 standard deviations from the mean were also excluded from the analysis.  A graph of RTs for Studies 2a and 2b can be found in Figure \ref{fig:e2line}.  

Because we were interested in the linear effect of context, results from these two studies were combined and analyzed together, with context condition re-coded as a continuous variable by calculating the proportion of people in each context condition who had a target item (e.g. the one condition in Study 2a was recoded as 1/3=.33; the one condition in Study 2b was recoded as 1/4=.25, etc.).

Study 2 examined how context affects participants' expectations about what each trial will look like.  We predicted that there would be an inverse linear effect of context, such that as the number of e.g. boys with apples in the context increased, reaction times to evaluate negative sentences would decrease.  Looking at Figure \ref{fig:e2line}, we see that as the proportion of target items in the context increases, reaction times tend to decrease, particularly for negative and false sentences, supporting our hypothesis.  However, reaction times appear to increase slightly in the ``all'' condition, giving the impression of a U-shaped relationship between context and RT.  

To examine the reliability of the linear relationship between context and RT, we first fit a linear mixed-effects model to reaction times in response to sentences.  We examined the interaction between sentence type, truth value, and context on reaction times.\footnote{The model specification was as follows: \texttt{RT $\sim$ sentence~$\times$~truth~$\times$~context + (sentence~$\times$~truth~\textbar~subject) +  (sentence~$\times$~truth~\textbar~item)}.}  As in Study 1, we found a significant effect of truth value, with significant faster reaction times for true sentences compared to false sentences ($\beta= -151$, $p< .001$).  Although there was not a significant main effect of negation, there was a significant interaction between sentence type and truth value, such that the difference between true positive and true negative was greater than the difference between the two types of false sentences ($\beta= 162$, $p< .001$).  We also found a linear effect of context on reaction time in line with our predictions, such that as the proportion of people with the target item in the context increased, reaction times decreased ($\beta= -167$, $p< .001$).   There was a significant 3-way interaction between context, sentence type, and truth value, such that the linear effect of context was most striking in true negative sentences ($\beta= -160$, $p< .01$).

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:e2line}, responses in the ``all'' condition suggest that the relationship between context and RT might not be entirely linear.  To test the significance of this curve, we added a term to our model to test for the quadratic effect of context.  This model was a significantly better fit to our data ($\chi^{2}(1) = 71.25$, $p<.001$).  This model reported a significant quadratic effect of context,  ($\beta= 696 $, $p< .001$).  ((NOTE: I'm not sure exactly how I should report these results.  Maybe I should discuss the u-shaped relationship earlier and then just report the results of the model with the quadratic term?  Everything else stays basically the same, so it wouldn't change the interpretation, just how the results are presented))

\subsection{Discussion}
Study 2 was designed to further examine the effect of context on reaction time.  We hypothesized that as the strength of the context increased (i.e. the number of boys with apples in the context), reaction times would decrease.  We found a significant linear effect of context, consistent with our prediction.  We also found a significant quadratic effect of context.  Looking at the data, it appears that the contexts that had the most significant effect on processing time were those in which 60\%-75\% of the characters in the context had the target item; contexts in which all of the characters had the target item lead to slightly increased reaction times.    

The results of Study 2 support our hypothesis that quantitatively manipulating the strength of the context results in systematic changes in sentence processing, particularly for true negative sentences.  We proposed that this effect is due to the ways that context influences how informative a sentence is about a given picture.  Our results are consistent with this finding.  As the proportion of people in the context with the target item increases, describing the trial picture as \emph{not} having that target item becomes more informative.  That is, the more people in the context who have e.g. apples, the more we expect a person with nothing to be described as ``a boy with no apples''.  

%\section{Study 3: Measuring Listener Expectations}
%In studies 1 and 2, we demonstrated that a simple visual context can facilitate the processing of negative sentences, and that there is a linear (quadratic?) relationship between the strength of the context and the effect on reaction time to evaluate negative sentences.  Contexts that set up a strong expectation lead to faster reaction times to process a negative sentence when that expectation is violated.  Our prediction was based on previous work demonstrating that participants expect speakers to be informative when speaking \cite{frank2012}.  If everyone in the context has a specific feature, and the trial character is lacking that feature, it is highly informative to describe the trial character in terms of the negation of the expected feature.  However, although the results of Studies 1 and 2 support this interpretation, we do not know for sure whether participants expect speakers to use negation in these contexts.  Study 3 attempts to directly measure participants' expectations of how a speaker would describe the pictures seen in Studies 1 and 2, depending on the context.

%Our hypothesis here draws on the idea of \emph{surprisal}, a information-theoretic measure of the amount of information contained in an utterance.  Previous work has proposed that the processing difficulty of a word is the surprisal of that word, calculated as the -log of the probability of the word occurring in a given syntactic and semantic context \cite{levy2008}.  This theory proposes that expectations about what utterance a speaker will produce are related to a listener's speed to evaluate that sentence.  We draw on this theory in the realm of pragmatics, developing pragmatic theory of surprisal to explain the effect of context on the processing of negative sentences.  

%To test this theory, we conducted a study to evaluate participants' expectations of how a speaker would describe a picture in a given context.  Participants were introduced to an imaginary speaker who was described as either ``an honest guy who says things that are plausible and true'' or ``a tricky guy who says things that are plausible but false''.  This was originally set up to test participants expectations about false sentences; however, participants in the ``tricky'' condition struggled to understand this task, and results from this condition are not presented here.  Participants were then shown a set of three or four characters that the speaker ostensibly also saw (the contexts from the previous studies), and then shown a single character and asked to bet whether the speaker would use different sentences to describe the picture.  This allowed us to calculate the surprisal of positive and negative sentences based on participants' expectations about what sentences a speaker would use to describe these pictures, and determine if a relationship exists between the pragmatic surprisal of a sentence and reaction times to evaluate those sentences.  

%\subsection{Method}

%\subsubsection{Participants}
%280 participants were recruited to participate in an online experiment through Amazon's Mechanical Turk website.  Participants ranged in age from 18 - 65+, with the majority of participants being between 25 and 35 (109 participants).  167 participants were male and 113 were female.  Participation was restricted to individuals in the United States, and participants who indicated that their primary language was something other than English were excluded from analysis.  Participants were paid 30 cents to participate in the study, which took approximately 5 minutes to complete.  

%\subsubsection{Stimuli}
%A subset of 12 items out of the items used in Studies 1 and 2 were used for this study.  As in the previous studies, these items consisted of a context which presented either three (Study 3a) or four (Study 3b) characters who were either holding two of the same item or holding nothing, and a trial character who was presented alone holding either two items or holding nothing.  

%On each trial, participants were given four sentences to bet on.  The four sentences were always a positive sentence involving the target item, a negative sentence involving the target item, a positive sentence involving an alternative item, and a negative sentence involving an alternative item.  This meant that for pictures of a person holding a target item (e.g. a picture of a boy with apples), the two true sentence options were the positive-item sentence and the negative-alternative sentence (e.g. ``A boy with apples'' and ``A boy with no cookies'').  For pictures of a person holding nothing, the two true sentence options were the negative-item sentence and the negative-alternative sentence (e.g. ``A boy with no apples'' and ``A boy with cookies'').   

%\subsubsection{Procedure}
%As in Studies 1 and 2, participants were first presented with an instructions screen which described the task and informed them that they would be participating in a psychology experiment and could stop at any time.  Once participants accepted the task, they were introduced to the speaker, Joe, who was described as ``an honest guy who says things that are plausible and true''.  They were told that they would see different pictures, and their job was to decide how likely Joe is to use different sentences to describe the picture.  Participants were told that they could bet on more than one sentence, but that their bets must sum to 100.  

%Participants were then given two trials to practice betting.  Practice trials always showed a person with items, and did not include context slides.  Participants were reminded of the task on each trial.  During practice trials, participants were only given positive sentences to choose from, and only one of the sentences was true.  If participants bet on a false sentence, they were reminded that the speaker is an honest person who says things that are true.  This feedback was not given during test trials.

%Experiment trials differed from practice trials in that participants first viewed a context slide similar to the context slides presented in Studies 1 and 2.  Participants saw three (Study 3a) or four (Study 3b) characters with either none, one, two, three, or four of the characters holding target items with the rest of the characters holding nothing.  Beneath the characters, participants were told ``Joe sees these [boys/girls]''.  The context screen was displayed for four seconds and then the experiment automatically proceeded to the test trial for that item.  

%Test trials showed a single boy or girl either holding the same items or holding nothing.  Under the picture were four sentences (positive-item, negative-item, positive-alternative, and negative-alternative).  Participants were told to place bets on whether Joe would use these sentences to describe this picture, and were reminded that their bets must sum to 100.

%Study 3 was designed to test the effect of context on people's expectations of how a speaker would describe a picture.  We predicted that there would be a correlation between participants predictions of what a speaker would say to describe a picture, and reaction times to evaluate the predicted sentences.  

%Eleven participants who listed a language other than English as their native language were excluded from analysis.  Forty-six additional participants were excluded for having participated in a previous iteration of the experiment. Thus, data from a total of 223 participants were analyzed.  

%In each trial, participants had the ability to bet on four possible sentences: a positive sentence about the target item, a negative sentence about the target item, a positive sentence about an alternative item, and a negative sentence about the alternative item.  Any bets on sentences that were logically false were excluded; very few participants bet on false sentences (the average participant allocated less than 5\% of their bets to false sentences).  This eliminated all bets to alternative-positive sentences (e.g. ``A boy with cookies'' when the target item was apples), because these sentences were always false.  We also eliminated all bets to alternative-negative items (e.g. ``A boy with no cookies'' when the target item was apples).  Although these sentences were sometimes true (e.g. when the trial picture showed a boy with nothing), we were interested in seeing how participants bets on item negative sentences changed as the context changed.  Thus, we only analyzed bets to item-positive sentences when the trial picture showed a character holding the target items (e.g. bets on ``A boy with apples'' when the picture showed a boy holding apples) and bets to item-negative sentences when the trial picture showed a character holding nothing (e.g. bets on ``A boy with no apples'' when the picture showed a boy holding nothing).  These were analogous to the True Positive and True Negative sentences in Studies 1 and 2, allowing us to compare expectations about what a speaker would say to participants' reaction times in Study 2.  

%We used participants' expectations about how a speaker would describe a given picture to calculate surprisal, an information-theoretic measure that previous work has suggested is related to the processing difficulty of a word \cite{levy2008}.  Surprisal is calculated as the -log of the probability of a word given the context.  We calculated the probability of a word given the context by taking the mean bet for each sentence type (true negative and true positive, as described above) for each context condition, and took the -log of these mean bets to compute the surprisal of each sentence type for each context condition.  We then compared this measure of surprisal to the mean reaction times for true positive and true negative sentences for each context condition, as measured in Study 2.  A graph of this comparison can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:e3plot}.  There was a significant correlation between surprisal and reaction time in these data ($r=.82$, $p<.001$).  

%\subsection{Discussion}

%In Studies 1 and 2, we found that including a visual contexts facilitates the processing of negative sentences, and that this effect is modulated by the strength of the expectation set up by the context.  As the proportion of people with a target item in the context increases, the reaction time to process a negative sentence that negates that target property decreases.  We postulated that this effect is due to the ways that context changes expectations about what a speaker might say to describe a picture.  If you see a context in which the majority of boys are holding apples, and then see a boy holding nothing, it makes sense to predict that the boy holding nothing might be described as a ``boy with no apples''.  However, if you see a context in which nobody is holding anything, it would be odd to describe another person holding nothing as ``a boy with no apples'', because you have no reason to expect that he \emph{would} have apples.  Our prediction was that these expectations, calculated as the surprisal of seeing a picture described using a certain sentence, would be positively correlated with reaction times from previous studies.  Study 3 confirmed this hypothesis.  

%Why is it that different contexts influence our predictions of how a speaker might describe a picture?  Our initial hypothesis was built on work by Frank and Goodman (2012), who created a model of language comprehension based on the Grice's Maxim of Quantity, which dictates that speakers should choose utterances that are maximally informative.  This model demonstrated that listeners expect speakers to produce utterances that are highly informative.  With respect to this work, the utterance ``A boy with no apples'' is highly informative if it refers to a boy with nothing in a world where every other boy has apples, because this utterance uniquely identifies the intended referent.  However, in a world where none of the other boys are holding apples, the sentence ``A boy with no apples'' is uninformative, because it refers to every other boy in this hypothetical world.  In the next section, we test whether a model of informativeness can predict processing times for true positive and true negative sentences.  

\section{Model}
In studies 1 and 2, we demonstrated that a simple visual context can facilitate the processing of negative sentences.  Contexts that set up a strong expectation lead to faster reaction times to process a negative sentence when that expectation is violated.  We suggest that the reason context has this effect is because participants expect speakers to be informative when speaking \cite{frank2012}.   If everyone in the context has a specific feature, and the trial character is lacking that feature, it is highly informative to describe the trial character in terms of the negation of the expected feature.  

Previous work has proposed that the processing difficulty of a word is the surprisal of that word, calculated as the -log of the probability of the word occurring in a given syntactic and semantic context \cite{levy2008}.  Here, we extend this theory to the realm of pragmatics.  Due to the difficulty of calculating the informativeness of a false sentence, we focused on modeling only the true sentences.  

\begin{figure}
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[width=3.25in]{figures/model1_comparison.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:model1_sims} Model predictions for a model of utterance surprisal, compared to reaction times in Study 2.  Error bars represent the 95\% confidence intervals.}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}

We modeled the behavior of participants in our experiments by calculating the surprisal of an utterance given the context and a specified referent.  To calculate the surprisal, we must first calculate the probability of the utterance occurring.  We define the probability of a phrase as proportional to the expected utility of that word.  ((Note: I include alpha here so I probably need to explain it and explain that we set alpha=1? I'm not sure how much detail to go into in explaining the model, in general.  I'm having trouble figuring out what I should cut and what I should include.))

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pw1}
P(w | r_s, C) \propto  e^{\alpha U(w;r_s,C)}
\end{equation}

We define the utility function as the informativeness of the phrase minus the cost

\begin{equation}\label{eq:utility}
e^{\alpha U(w;r_s,C)} = I(w;r_s, C) - D(w)
\end{equation}

Drawing on previous work on modeling pragmatic reasoning, we quantify informativeness as the negative surprisal of the extension of the utterance in context; that is, the number of objects in the context for which that utterance is true.  

\begin{equation}\label{eq:info}
I(w;r_s, C) = -(-log(|w|^{-1}))
\end{equation}

Cost can be defined in a number of ways; in this model we define it as the number of words in the utterance multiplied by a cost-per-word parameter.  Note that in our experiment, the negative sentences always have exactly one word more than the positive sentences.  Combining equations 1-3, and summing over all possible words in the vocabulary V, we get:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pw2}
P(w | r_s, C) = \frac{ e^{log(|w|^{-1}) - D(w)}} {\sum_{w' \in V}{e^{log(|w'|^{-1}) - D(w')}}}
\end{equation}

We can then calculate the surprisal of the utterance by taking the -log of the probability of the word, which we predict will be related to participants reaction times to respond to the same sentences in the same contexts \cite{levy2008}.

This model makes the prediction that as the number of e.g. boys with apples in the context increases, the informativeness of a negative sentences such as ``Bob has no apples'' increases, because the negative sentence selects an increasingly smaller subset of the context, and sentences that are more informative are higher probability.  As the probability of a sentence increases, the surprisal will decrease, and we expect these surprisal scores to be positively correlated with reaction times.

We tested this model on the nine context conditions from studies 2a and 2b (i.e. four possible contexts in 2a and five in 2b), with cost-per-word = 2 (CHECK THIS), and compared the model predictions (surprisal) to our data in Studies 2a and 2b.  A plot of model fit can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:model1_sims}. 

This model was a reasonable fit to our experimental data, with a correlation of $r=.72$ (not sure how to report this...significance?  Should I report positive/negative sentence correlations, or just this correlation with all of the data?).  The model accurately predicts that negative sentences are more surprising (i.e. higher reaction times), and captures many of the context effects.  However, there are several points that this model is failing to capture.  Specifically, it is underestimating the surprisal of None contexts for positive sentences, and All contexts for negative sentences; that is, our model is failing to capture the U-shaped relationship found between context and reaction time in Study 2.  

To understand the shortcomings of our model, we considered the experimental contexts which our model was failing to accurately predict surprisal: None contexts for positive sentences, and All contexts for negative sentences.  In our experimental paradigm, participants first saw the context slide \emph{without} the target, and then later saw the target picture separate from the context.  For None contexts followed by a True Positive trial, this means that participants saw three boys with nothing, and then saw a boy holding something.  For All contexts followed by a True Negative trial, participants saw three boys holding identical items, and then saw a boy with nothing.  In these trials, participants may have found the target picture surprising, regardless of the sentence that they read.  

To account for this, we included a term of "Person Surprisal" in our model.  We calculate the probability of seeing a particular person, given the context C, as the number people who match that particular person (i.e. number of people with apples for positive trials, and the number of people without apples for negative trials), divided by the total number of people in the context, with a smoothing parameter lambda: ((I don't really know how to write this equation))

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pp}
P(person | C) =  \frac{n MatchingPeople  + \uplambda}{nTotalPeople + 2\uplambda}
\end{equation}

We then added the -log of the probability of seeing a particular person given the context (Equation \ref{eq:pp}) to the -log of the probability of hearing an utterance given the referent and the context (Equation \ref{eq:pw2}), with a weighting parameter w to adjust the different effects of these two surprisals, to get a complete model of surprisal:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:total}
surprisal = -log(P(person|C)) + w*-log(P(w|r_s, C))
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center} 
\includegraphics[width=3.25in]{figures/model2_comparison.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:model2_sims} Model predictions for a model of Total Surprisal (Equation \ref{eq:total}, compared to reaction times in Study 2.  Error bars represent the 95\% confidence intervals.}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}

We tested this new model on the nine context conditions from studies 2a and 2b, with cost-per-word = .5, lambda=.2, and w=.4 (CHECK THIS), and compared the new model predictions to our data in Studies 2a and 2b.  A plot of model fit can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:model2_sims}. 

This model showed a strong fit to our data, with a correlation of $r=.89$ for all data, and separate correlations of $r=.78$ for positive sentences and $r=.91$ for negative sentences.  (((NOTE: I'm wondering if I should first fit the model to Study 2a, and then use those parameter values and report fit for Study 2b or the total data set.  This is what I did when I presented the model, but I'm not sure if that takes up too much space?)))

Do I need a specific discussion here or can I just transition directly into the general discussion?

\section{General Discussion}

This paper explores the relationship between the processing of negative sentences and the contexts in which these sentences are presented.  Previous work has shown that although it takes longer to evaluate negative sentences than positive sentences when test sentences are presented with no context \cite{carpenter1975, just1971, just1976, hclark1972}, the presence of supportive pragmatic context \cite{wason1965, dale2011, glenberg1999, ludtke2006} can facilitate the processing of negative sentences.  This suggests that a pragmatic account of negative sentences is warranted, such that negative sentences are licensed in contexts which set up an expectation which is then violated.  However, the extent to which expectation modulates the processing of negative sentences has not been systematically explored until now.  

In the studies presented here, we quantitatively manipulated the expectation set up by the context by changing the proportion of people in the context who held a certain target item.  We found a parametric relationship between the strength of the context and reaction times to respond to negative sentences.  We created a model of the surprisal of possible utterances which demonstrated that the informativeness of a sentence given the context, combined with the surprisal of seeing a given referent, is correlated with participants' reaction times in response to true sentences in the same contexts.  

((I need more here, but I'm not sure what?)

Although our specific focus for this work was to understand the processing of negative sentences, this work can be extended to quantify the effect that context has on sentence processing more generally.  Debates about the effects of pragmatics on linguistic processing exist in other domains as well (e.g. the processing of scalar implicatures, \citeNP{huang2009, huang2011, grodner2010}).  Formal models of pragmatics can shed light on the nature of the role that context plays in linguistic processing.
